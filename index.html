									<h2>Paper Review</h2>
									<b>Most of papers listed below were part of the Ph.D. class "Empirical Research in Accounting" taught by the esteemed Prof.
										<a href="https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/john-mcinnis/">John Mcinnis</a>.
										Prof. McInnis graciously provided me with two syllabi from his class, 
										and I read the papers organized by topic. 
										I grouped the papers based on their themes and added tags to highlight the most memorable points for each. 
										Additionally, I have included the pros and cons for each paper as well as slides I made.</b><br><br>

									<b>Some papers listed below were from Ph.D. class "BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH IN ACCOUNTING" taught by the esteemed Prof.
										<a href="https://business.cornell.edu/faculty-research/faculty/bjw235/">Brian White</a>.
										Since I would not do behavioral Research, I read those for trying to using machine learning, deep learning & 
										advanced computation tools to do behavioral questions in empirical ways. Still there are sildes, tags. cons and pros for thos papers
										</b><br><br>
									
									<b>Other paper could be works of <a href="https://www.bryankellyacademic.org/">Bryan Kelly</a> or some works related to 
										alternative data, machine learning and other methods in accounting research. I consider this part of papers my toolkit.
