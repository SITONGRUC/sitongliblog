									<b>Two types of research related to machine learning in finance</b><br>
									<b>May 2024</b><br>
									<br>In this post, I will briefly explore two types of research related to machine learning in finance. The research can be categorized into two main areas: firstly, studies that integrate machine learning with financial theories; and secondly, research that employs machine learning primarily for data processing or regression analysis. Finally, I will provide a list of the papers I have reviewed on this topic.<br>

										<b>Tags:[Disclosure] | [Redaction] </b><br>
										<br>Pros include an extension about literatures on how managements deal with bad news <br>
